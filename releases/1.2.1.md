## perceval 1.2.1 - (2025-05-09)

**Bug fixes:**

 * GitHub API not returning issues (#865)\
   The GitHub API does not return issues when using the epoch time
   (1970-01-01). This has been temporarily fixed by using 1980-01-01 as
   the from-date.
 * GitHub API pagination bug\
   Fixed a bug where pagination stopped working after the GitHub API
   stopped providing a reference to the last page.
 * GitHub user data fallback\
   When the API returns a 404 for a user, Perceval returns the basic user
   data available in the related issue, pull request, comment, or review.
 * Git filename with curly brackets issue\
   Perceval misinterpreted file paths with curly brackets as rename or
   move actions, causing new files to be created without an associated
   action.
