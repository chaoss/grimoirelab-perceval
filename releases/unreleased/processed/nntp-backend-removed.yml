title: NNTP backend removed for Python > 3.13
category: deprecated
author: Jose Javier Merchante <jjmerchante@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
  nntplib is no longer part of the Python standard library.
  It was removed in Python 3.13 after being deprecated in
  Python 3.11 (PEP 594).

  This version raises an exception when trying to use
  the NNTP backend and nntplib package is not available.
