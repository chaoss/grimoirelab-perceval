title: Refactor Backend Fetch Logic

notes: >
  Refactored the `Backend` class to simplify and improve maintainability.
  The `fetch` method is no longer overridden in subclasses. Instead,
  subclasses are only required to implement the `fetch_items` method, where
  the specific data retrieval logic is defined. This change ensures that any
  updates to the `fetch` method in the `Backend` class are automatically
  inherited by all subclasses, reducing the need to propagate changes across
  multiple classes.
