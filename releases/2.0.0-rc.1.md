## perceval 2.0.0-rc.1 - (2025-04-08)

**Feature removals:**

 * NNTP backend removed for Python > 3.13\
   nntplib is no longer part of the Python standard library. It was
   removed in Python 3.13 after being deprecated in Python 3.11 (PEP
   594). This version raises an exception when trying to use the NNTP
   backend and nntplib package is not available.
