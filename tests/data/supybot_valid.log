2012-10-17T09:16:21+0000  <benpol> So the performance degradations people are seeing over time with btrfs, people feel that theyr
2012-10-17T09:16:29+0000  <benpol> they're related to fragmentation?
2012-10-17T09:16:29+0000  <benpol>
2012-10-17T09:16:35+0000  * benpol is wondering...

2012-10-17T09:17:27+0000  <benpol> if so, have there been any improvements in performance over time with the auto-defrag option enabled for the btrfs mount points?
2012-10-17T09:18:48+0000  <Tv_> joao: vger is a *huge* mailing list host, and it's quite unlikely to have issues, apart from a bad attitude toward non-old school users

2012-10-17T09:24:43+0000  <nhm> benpol: fragmentation might be part of it.  We notice writes get more seeky over time.  It may be due to where on the disk file/directory metadata resides vs where data ends up as new data is written.
2012-10-17T09:24:55+0000  <joao> Tv_, I know, but assuming that has any other service it might incur in occasional issues is not that far fetched :p
2012-10-17T09:25:34+0000  <Tv_> joao: yeah it's just not the Occam's razor approved branch of reality ;)
2012-10-17T09:25:52+0000  <joao> heh
2012-10-17T09:25:55+0000  <jamespage> scuttlemonkey: glad you liked it - ping me if you find any issues....
2012-10-17T09:26:02+0000  <Tv_> srsly i think vger handles more mail than usenet as a whole had posts when i got introduced to it
2012-10-17T09:26:25+0000  <Tv_> and it's not like some social media vomit, this is long emails & patches etc
2012-10-17T09:26:39+0000  <joao> I'm sure it does
2012-10-17T09:26:46+0000  <Tv_> it's like staring at the fury of creation
2012-10-17T09:26:54+0000  <Tv_> linux-kernel at least feels that way

2012-10-17T09:29:41+0000  <joao> sagewk, pushed mon-coverity-fixes
2012-10-17T09:29:56+0000  <scuttlemonkey> jamespage: will do, went a lot better after I talked to Mark Ramm et al and got the latest one from you and not the older one in /precise/
2012-10-17T09:30:26+0000  <joao> tackled down some medium-priority ones, but will check for more
2012-10-17T09:30:30+0000  <jamespage> scuttlemonkey, yeah - the new ones do things quite differently

2012-10-17T09:43:03+0000  <sagewk> joao: the authmonitor one could probalby just call get_auth and use the return value as the condition for the preceding if block
2012-10-17T09:43:25+0000  <sagewk> instead of calling contains and then asserting the subsequent get succeeds
2012-10-17T09:44:27+0000  <joao> yeah, that sounds more adequate; fixing it

2012-10-17T23:34:21+0000  <Q310> its so anoying i can create rbd's with cinder etc, i can even image a rbd from glance with cinder but yet when i create a new vm with the dashboard it seems to know nothing about rbd
2012-10-17T23:34:48+0000  <Q310> i can even create the rbd's in the dashboard as additional volumes no worries but not provision/boot from one
